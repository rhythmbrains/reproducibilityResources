### Data management

#### Command line

#### Git

* [Software carpentry tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
* [Attlasian tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository) 

Once you know the basics, it's super insightful to learn about different practical workflows: 

* [chapter on Attlasian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows) 
* [Jenny Bryan's course](https://happygitwithr.com/) (although somewhat specific to R)

#### Datalad 

* [Datalad handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/index.html) (see the [chapter](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-139-gin.html) on GIN data hosting)

* Online video tutorials

### EEG analysis 

To learn Matlab, signal processing, and stats, see [Mike X Cohen's courses on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/mike-x-cohen/). Paid but totally worth it. Couple of times a year Udemy have massive discounts (10$ per course), don't ever pay the full price!


Guidelines to **organize** your analysis pipeline have been recently written by [van Vliet (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007358). Even though he uses MNE-python, there are super useful ideas there that apply generally (to Matlab too ;) The only thing I don't like is that he doesn't use BIDS.

### BIDS

[EEG BIDS paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0104-8), not very informative imo. 

The BIDS [spcecification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/03-electroencephalography.html) is super detailed and informative. 

Loads of [example datasets here](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples). Most are MRI, but have a look at the "eeg_" ones. 

CPP lab is developing a nice [Matlab toolbox](https://github.com/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_BIDS) that can do the BIDS heavy lifting.

### R 

[Resources](http://www.hiercourse.com) from super nice guys at the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment at Western Sydney University. They used to do a life-changing course on R back in the day (before Remko left to NL).

### Math

[Mathematical Tools for Neural and Cognitive Science](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/math-tools19/) is all you ever wanted to know (careful, danger of falling in love with Eero).
